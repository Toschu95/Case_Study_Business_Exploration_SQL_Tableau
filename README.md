# SQL & Tableau Business Exploration Case Study

**Description:**  
This repository contains code, visualizations and a brief business presentation of a case study for business exploration conducted during a coding bootcamp via SQL, Tableau and Google Slides. The data originates from the magist_dump SQL database and has been converted into CSV datasets for further analysis. The project includes the original SQL dump, transformation scripts, and final visualizations used to enrich the final presentation with plots and insights.

## Setup & Usage

This setup guide is written for **Mac**; adapt commands accordingly for other platforms.

### Requirements

- **MySQL** installation is required to set up and use the magist database.
- **Tableau Desktop** or **Tableau Public** (for visual exploration)

### Importing Database & Running Queries

1. **Download and place `magist_dump.sql` in the `10_sql/data/` directory.**
   
3. **Create the database in MySQL:**

   ```sh
   mysql -u your_user -p
   CREATE DATABASE magist;
   EXIT;
   ```

4. **Import the SQL dump:**

   ```sh
   mysql -u your_user -p magist < 10_sql/data/magist_dump.sql
   ```

5. **Verify the data in MySQL:**

   ```sh
   mysql -u your_user -p
   USE magist;
   SHOW TABLES;
   ```

6. **Run additional SQL queries:**

   ```sh
   chmod +x 10_sql/sql_queries/run_queries.sh
   ./10_sql/sql_queries/run_queries.sh
   ```

7. **Open `main_workbook.twbx` in Tableau to access visualization sheets.**

8. **If data sources are missing in Tableau:**
   - Go to **Data Sources → Edit Connection**.
   - Select the new location of the CSV files or database.
   - Refresh the data to ensure consistency.
